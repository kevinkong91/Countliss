		<h3 class='heading'>About Countliss</h3>
		
		<div class='text'>
		<h1>Countliss's mission is to discover, organize and deliver value.</h1>
		
		<p>Countliss has collected a large store of the world's information on sales, coupons, deals, and promotions from across multiple print
		and online sources that would bring every user greater purchasing power, and ultimately, more happiness.</p>
		
		<p>In a world of <a href='media/cnh_money.jpg'>economic troubles</a> and cluttered information (think of all the coupons you forgot to bring, all the sales on different TV ads,
		the pennysavers that get thrown away... you get the point), every dollar needs to count more and we can't afford to miss out on such opportunities.
		For businesses, increasing options and mediums confuses customers and dilutes their brand, instead of empowering their voice.
		To that end, we believe our products can make a positive impact on the world.</p>
		
		<p>Countliss, a portmanteau of countless and bliss, is a value-driven company of talented people who realize that, you can count money and you can number your days, but value and meaning in the wallet or in those days are simply countless.
		Rather, life is about the little things, the pursuit of meaningful interactions and experiences that makes this all worth it. Our small hope is that our
		products and services will better enable our devoted users to achieve, well, just that.</p>
		
		<h2>Because life is simply countliss.</h2>
